            <h1>DEPRESSION</h1>
            <p>Sadness, feeling down, having a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities - these are symptoms familiar to all of us. But, if they persist and affect our life substantially, it may be depression.<br>Depression is a mood disorder characterized
                by persistently low mood and a feeling of sadness and loss of interest.Diagnosis of depression starts with a consultation with a doctor or mental health specialist. It is important to seek the help of a health professional to rule out
                different causes of depression, ensure an accurate differential diagnosis, and secure safe and effective treatment.<br>Depression is different from the fluctuations in mood that people experience as a part of normal life. Temporary emotional
                responses to the challenges of everyday life do not constitute depression.</p>
            <p>
                The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. The symptoms can be psychological, physical or social. Here are some of the most common symptoms.
                <br><br><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>feeling low often</li>
                    <li>having low self-esteem</li>
                    <li>feeling irritable and intolerant of others</li>
                    <li>having no motivation or interest in things</li>
                    <li>thoughts of self harm</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br><strong>PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>changes in appetite</li>
                    <li>distrubed sleep</li>
                    <li>weight loss or weight gain</li>
                    <li>lathargy</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br><strong>SOCIAL SYMPTOMS</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>avoiding contact with friends</li>
                    <li>neglecting hobbes and interests</li>
                    <li>taking part in fewer if not any activites</li>
                </ul>
                <br> The severity of depression depends upon its impact on your life. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong.

            <h1>ANXIETY</h1>
            <p>Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses that lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry. When a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder.These disorders
                alter how a person processes emotions and behave, also causing physical symptoms. Mild anxiety might be vague and unsettling, while severe anxiety may seriously affect day-to-day living.<br> Anxiety is defined as "an emotion characterized
                by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure."Knowing the difference between normal feelings of anxiety and an anxiety disorder requiring medical attention can help a person identify and treat
                the condition. Because while anxiety can cause distress, it is not always a medical condition.<br><br><strong> Anxiety</strong>
                <br> When an individual faces potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival. Since the earliest days of humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger sets off alarms
                in the body and allows evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings. The danger causes a rush of adrenalin, a hormone and chemical messenger in the
                brain, which in turn triggers these anxious reactions in a process called the "fight-or-flight' response. This prepares humans to physically confront or flee any potential threats to safety. Anxieties now revolve around work, family, health,
                education, money and other crucial issues that demand a person's attention without necessarily requiring the 'fight-or-flight' reaction.The nervous feeling before an important life event or during a difficult situation is a natural echo
                of the original 'fight-or-flight' reaction and isn't a cause for concern.
                <br><br><strong>Anxiety disorders</strong><br> The duration or severity of an anxious feeling can sometimes be out of proportion to the original trigger, or stressor. Physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and nausea, may
                also develop. These responses move beyond anxiety into an anxiety disorder.Once anxiety reaches the stage of a disorder, it can interfere with daily function.
                <br> While a number of different diagnoses constitute anxiety disorders, the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) will often include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>restlessness, and a feeling of being "on-edge"</li>
                    <li>uncontrollable feelings of worry</li>
                    <li>increased irritability</li>
                    <li>concentration difficulties</li>
                    <li>sleep difficulties, such as problems in falling or staying asleep</li>
                </ul>While these symptoms might be normal to experience in daily life, people with GAD will experience them to persistent or extreme levels.
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder: </strong>This is a chronic disorder involving excessive, long-lasting anxiety and worries about nonspecific life events, objects, and situations. GAD is the most common anxiety disorder, and people
                        with the disorder are not always able to identify the cause of their anxiety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Panic disorder:</strong> Brief or sudden attacks of intense terror and apprehension characterize panic disorder. These attacks can lead to shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and breathing difficulties. Panic attacks tend
                        to occur and escalate rapidly, peaking after 10 minutes. However, a panic attack might last for hours.<br> Panic disorders usually occur after frightening experiences or prolonged stress but may also occur without a trigger. An
                        individual experiencing a panic attack may misinterpret it as a life-threatening illness, and may make drastic changes in behavior to avoid future attacks.</li>

            <h1>PTSD</h1>
            <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable
                thoughts about the event. Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years,
                and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms
                cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance,
                negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.<br><br>Intrusive memories
                <br> Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:
                <br> Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event<br> Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)<br> Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event<br> Severe emotional distress
                or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event<br>
                <br>
                <br> Avoidance
                <br> Symptoms of avoidance may include:
                <br> Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event<br> Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event<br> Negative changes in thinking and mood<br>
                <br> Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:
                <br> Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world<br> Hopelessness about the future<br> Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event<br> Difficulty maintaining close relationships<br>                Feeling detached from family and friends<br> Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed<br> Difficulty experiencing positive emotions<br> Feeling emotionally numb<br> Changes in physical and emotional reactions<br>
                <br> Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:
                <br><br> Being easily startled or frightened<br> Always being on guard for danger<br> Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast<br> Trouble sleeping<br> Trouble concentrating<br> Irritability, angry outbursts
                or aggressive behavior<br> Overwhelming guilt or shame<br></p>

            <h1>SOCIAL ANXIETY</h1>
            <p>We all know the feeling of being nervous or uncomfortable in a social situation.Maybe you’ve clammed up when meeting someone new or gotten sweaty palms before making a big presentation. Public speaking or walking into a roomful of strangers
                isn’t exactly thrilling for everybody, but most people can get through it. If you have social anxiety disorder, though, the stress of these situations is too much to handle. You might avoid all social contact because things that other
                people consider “normal” -- like making small talk and eye contact -- make you so uncomfortable. All aspects of your life, not just the social, could start to fall apart. Social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) is one of
                the most common mental disorders, so if you have it, there’s hope. The tough part is being able to ask for help. Here’s how to know if your social silence has gone beyond shyness to a point where you need to see a doctor.
                <br> So, when does it happen? Anyone with social anxiety disorder can experience it in different ways. But here are some common situations that people tend to have trouble with:
                <ul>
                    <li>Talking to strangers</li>
                    <li>public speaking</li>
                    <li>Entering rooms</li>
                    <li>making eye contact</li>
                    <li>starting conversations</li>
                </ul>
                The experience may be different for everyone, but if you have social anxiety and you’re in a stressful situation, you might have physical symptoms like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
                    <li>Muscle Tension</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea</li>
                    <li>Out of breath</li>

                </ul>
