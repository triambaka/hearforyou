    <button class="accordion">What does depression feel like? </button>
    <div class="panel" style="font-family: cursive; font-size: small;">
        <p>It's like drowning, it's like an addiction, you want to get out of it but at the same time you don't and it feels awful because no one can understand you.</p><br>
        <p>It's like alternating between feeling stuck in the past and worrying about the future. Like feeling stupid for something you said, and ruminating in that, and then worrying about saying more stupid things the next time you have to go interact
            with people.</p><br>
        <p>Its like being trapped in a mind where you are never happy and when you are it doesn't feel right. You get use to not being happy and learn to accept it.</p><br>

    <button class="accordion">Does ADHD affect your intelligence?</button>
    <div class="panel" style="font-family: cursive; font-size: small;">
        <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 2 years old after getting the chicken pox vaccination, all my life I was scared of people making fun of me because of being considered ESE which is another way of saying special needs. To correctly answer
            the question; no it does not effect ones intelligence but only makes it a bit harder to put full focus on the task at hand. If you are ADHD and would like some more information please contact me as I have had it many years.</p><br>
        <p>It doesnt affect the intelligence itself. What it does effect though is your ability to use your intelligence. If you cant concentrate on a task you might not be able to complete it, even though intelligence-wise you would be able to.</p><br>
        <p>It does not but it might impair you effectiveness of performing different tasks that rely on concentration and systematic execution of learning tasks.</p><br>

    <button class="accordion">What's the best way to get over someone calling you nasty names?</button>
    <div class="panel" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: small;">
        <p>For me the best way is to just plainly ignore everyone calling you names. What also worked for me was smiling to the ones and saying Hi back. Most people calling you names want to see you get hurt. Don't give them that satisfaction :)</p><br>
        <p>Learning to accept that you arent the names they call you. You are more than that and deserve better.</p><br>
        <p>Ignore them. You may have been told to do this multiple times and found it hard, but its the best thing to do as they will get fed up of talking to nothing soon. If you let those comments affect you, they will keep doing that, because is like
            a game for them but if you ignore it, they will get tired and leave you in peace!</p><br>

    <button class="accordion">How can I improve my self esteem?</button>
    <div class="panel" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: small;">
        <p>There are lots of different ways that you can improve your self-esteem; probably more than we could ever list here! - Try to increase your positive self-talk. What are the things that are good about yourself? Write them down, notice them - say
            them, scream them out loud! They are important. When we are stuck in low self-esteem we tend to dismiss them or forget them. - Take note of some of the terrible things you say about yourself. These might be comments like "I'm stupid" or "I'm
            such a failure". How true are they really? Often these thoughts are automatic so it's not easy - but it makes a huge difference. - Try to stop comparing yourself to other people. You're not like other people! You're you. - Focus on the things
            that you do enjoy. Find time for them; whether that's your hobbies/interests, family/friends or just things you like in general. :)</p><br>
        <p>There are many things you can try. The important thing is to be consistent. If you want to give yourself 5 compliments every day and write them down, that is a great way to start!</p><br>
        <p>By looking at success rather than failure. By counting the positive things in your life. By performing good acts that help others.</p><br>

    <button class="accordion">I am afraid to socialize. How do I overcome this?</button>
    <div class="panel" style="font-family: cursive;font-size: small;">
        <p>Sometimes you may define yourself as an introvert. Not keen on a very stimulating environment where you have to engage everybody around you. It seems like too much work and kind of scary sometimes! The reality is this: just like a muscle, you
            can train your social skills! An born introvert CAN become a full blown extrovert! You may think you are too overly conscientious.. but that is your strength! Take the time to research some techniques and skills online! </p><br>
        <p>Many people are afraid to socialize, including the popular people, but they just make it seems like they are pro at it. To overcome this, taking time to practise and preparing beforehand can really help. Practising in front of a mirror or with
            a friend can also help to improve your communication and overcome your fear.</p><br>
        <p>A fear of socializing is normal. Socializing can be very challenging. Try and figure out what is making you not socialize. What is happening or has happened to you before that makes socializing difficult. If you should start anywhere this is where.
            Identifying the problem is key to improving your fear of socialization. Once you work on the problem socializing might seem easier to do. Every day try and be conscious of wha it’s keeping you from socializing. Work through the fear to eliminate
            it. One day soon, a fear of socialization will be a thing of the past.</p><br>
